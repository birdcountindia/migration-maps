# Animated migration maps

These migration maps are GIFs of various migratory bird species, showing how their distribution across the globe changes across seasons. They are extremely popular and a great way of engaging audiences with data on bird migration. 

First, unfortunately, all the individual species data files (for the whole world) need to be downloaded manually and saved in the appropriate folder. After this, the workflow is automated so the pipeline script can be run directly.
